- P1:
    - How to make sure we'll synchronize our station after network gets up again?
        - Field in DB showing if it was sent?
        - Periodic task fanning out our new rows?
        - ACKs? Can RabbitMQ do it?
    - A random metric generator.
    - Writer to the DB
        - Need to agree on format between agent and server
        - ACKs?

- P2:
    - Tooz Service Groups.
        - We would know how many nodes we have! We can count ACKs.
        - We can know cluster status.
        - Redis!
