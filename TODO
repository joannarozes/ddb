- P1:
    - How to make sure we'll synchronize our station after network gets up again?
        - Column in DB showing if row was sent. (Michał)
        - Periodic task fanning out our new rows. (Asia)
        - Only mark a row as sent if we receive all the ACKs for it...? (Michał&Asia)
            - We can get number of ACKs needed from the DB probably...
            - Another idea - if every receiver will have a queue bounded to our
              fanout exchange - won't RabbitMQ keep it for it?
                - This depends on the fact if RabbitMQ keeps queue bounded when
                  client gets disconnected.
    - A random metric generator. (Maciek)

- P2:
    - Removing a station. (Michał&Asia&Maciek)
        - Just remove it from the DB.
        - Such operation needs locks to not mess everything up (in case of ACKs).
    - Tooz Service Groups. (Michał)
        - We would know how many nodes we have! We can count ACKs (DB solves this too tough).
        - We can know cluster status.
        - Redis is needed for that!
